Further cleanup, forking etc of the various Android repos. Comments are indicated with FIXME in default.xml and lineage.xml

The following seems Mer specific and needs to be confirmed if usable for Halium and other distro's:

### minisf 
Probably useful for various media bits as well. So we'll keep it I guess.
Mini surfaceflinger: https://github.com/mer-hybris/android_frameworks_native/commit/73601623ebfe04060054e070cf12c291b6ffe0da

#### busybox
Check prebuilt busybox at https://github.com/mer-hybris/android_external_busybox_prebuilt

Why can't we build it ourselves? I suspect Mer's busybox might not be suitable for Halium 1:1

https://github.com/mer-hybris/android_system_core/commit/248621be4c30b03c696099a49f77d47bb2d70af9 which probably needs additional .sh scripts as used by Mer such as: https://github.com/mautz-kernel/droid-config-hammerhead/blob/master/installroot/usr/bin/droid/droid-hal-shutdown.sh
